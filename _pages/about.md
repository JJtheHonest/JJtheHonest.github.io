Jiajie Yin is an undergraduate student at Beijing Normal University majoring in Data Science and Big Data Technology. With a strong foundation in mathematics, programming, and data analysis, he has excelled academically. Jiajie has participated in several research projects, including developing interactive simulation platforms for swarm behavior and optimizing resource allocation in mobile edge computing with UAV systems. Supervised by Prof. [Zhiqing Tang](https://www.zhiqingtang.com/), their research has led to published work in top-tier journals and a national patent.

*My research interests include multi-agent systems, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and edge computing, with a focus on applying AI to swarm intelligence and IoT. *

**I am looking for opportunities to pursue a master's degree in these areas and to collaborate on cutting-edge projects. Please contact me if you are interested in my profile!**

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
