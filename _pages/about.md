Jiajie Yin is an undergraduate student at Beijing Normal University majoring in Data Science and Big Data Technology. With a strong foundation in mathematics, programming, and data analysis, he has excelled academically. Jiajie has participated in several research projects, including developing interactive simulation platforms for swarm behavior and optimizing resource allocation in mobile edge computing with UAV systems. Supervised by Prof. [Zhiqing Tang](https://www.zhiqingtang.com/), their research has led to published work in top-tier journals (IEEE IoT-Journal, JCR-Q1) and a national patent.

*My research interests include **multi-agent systems**, **deep learning**, **reinforcement learning**, and **edge computing**, with a focus on applying AI to swarm intelligence and IoT.*

Projects
======
- **The Study on Mechanisms and Patterns of Two Opposing Swarm Movements *(Physics/Complex Systems, 2022–2023)*** \
  ***(National Class Project)** (Undergraduate Training Programs for Innovation and Entrepreneurship)*

  This research project was supervised by Dr. [Guiyuan Shi](https://fas.bnu.edu.cn/jyjg/xsgk/xtkxx1/xsszxtkx/xtkxzj/b90f27925dd8422a99895554a88884f2.htm) from the International Academic Center of Complex Systems, Advanced Institute of Natural Sciences, Beijing Normal University.\
  As a core member, I led the key aspects of the project, including:
  - Implemented classical swarm models like Boids, Vicsek, and Couzin using Python.
  - Extended models to 3D space and introduced opposing swarms, designing interaction mechanisms to study their dynamic behaviors.
  - Developed an interactive simulation platform, CouzinSim, featuring customizable parameters and clear visualizations. The tool serves both research and educational purposes and is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/QZGao/couzin-sim).

- **Online Container Scheduling and Resource Optimization for Digital Twin Edge Networks *(Participate as an undergraduate RA, 2023–Present)*** \
  ***(National Class Project)** (Supported by the Young Scientists Fund of the National Natural Science Foundation of China)*

  This research project was supervised by Prof. [Zhiqing Tang](https://www.zhiqingtang.com/).\
  We introduced a composite user model to enhance system reliability by addressing the challenges of high mobility and heterogeneity in edge computing scenarios. A novel reinforcement learning approach is proposed for optimizing UAV task scheduling and resource allocation. We conducted extensive simulations to validate the proposed algorithm’s superior performance in large-scale UAV-MEC scenarios. As the first author, I contributed to a paper and a patent application:
  - **Publication**: *QoS-aware Energy-efficient Multi-UAV Offloading Ratio and Trajectory Control Algorithm in Mobile Edge Computing (IEEE IoT-Journal, JCR-Q1) [[PDF](https://jjthehonest.github.io/files/IoT-J2024.pdf)]*
  - **Patent**: *Method and Device for UAV-Assisted Offloading Strategy (Patent Application No. 2024109978530)*
